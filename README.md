# odin-recipes

This is my first HTML project Called "Recipes". I will be demonstrating my skills that I have learned so far. The main index page will also link to other pages to various recipes.

I will also demonstrate my abilities using Git and GitHub. Creating a repository and using the correct practices when creating my subject and body of my commits.
